# Planar Data classification with a hidden layer
 
Welcome to the second programming of the deep learning. In this notebook we will generate red and blue points to form a flower. we will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. We will try different layers and see the results.


By completing this assignment we will:

- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

Take your time to complete it and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the different exercises. In some code blocks, you will find a "#GRADED FUNCTION: functionName" comment. Please do not modify it.
